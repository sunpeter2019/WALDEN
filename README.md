# WALDEN

Thanks for all of you for your interest in our work.


We propose a novel Workload-Aware
Learned Tree Index (WALDEN) which sets weights to keys and
arranges important keys into the shallower levels of the tree index.

This project contains the code of WALDEN and welcomes contributions or suggestions.
